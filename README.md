<!-- TO DO -->
- myMusic modal... when there are more than 3 pieces, the modal gets slightly bigger, causing there to be a difference in height when scrolling through the albums. In addition, the scroll bar when scrolling through the pieces conflicts with the buttons, needs to be more to the righthandside. and it is not obvious to the user that scrolling is an options on the albums with more than 3 songs.
- Make the nav links link to the correct place, atm they link to benSpooner homepage
- when I navigate between benSpooner and sponn, it doesn't always jump to the homepage, it stays on the part of the screen that it was on before... eg... on benSpooner if I'm on the aboutMe page and I click on sponn, it navigates to the myMusic page instead of the sponn homepage.
- I need to make a modal for the book instead of having breadcrumb on the page to navigate between the pages. This will keep the style in sync with the music modal.
- Add arrows tot eh book description like aboutMe summary text.
- Add text to each album on myMusic on sponn as the page looks a little empty.
- Complete the myScores section on sponn
- Create a whole new version with green and pine.
  - What would the 3 pages consist of??
  - Probably a myMusic section, but what would the 3rd be?
- Am I creating a game for the website?
- Once I click on a nav, I then cant scroll on the page, it stays on the homepage
