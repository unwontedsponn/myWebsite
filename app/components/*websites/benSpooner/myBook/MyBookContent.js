    {`Beginner To Composer In 14 Days is delightfully different. Moving swiftly from theory to action, Ben emerges as the teacher you always wished you'd had, championing radical creative freedom, improvisation and composition - even for beginners. Especially for beginners in fact. "Students need freedom to truly fall in love with their instrument" he writes, "frameworks that pique their curiosity over and over again so that practice becomes play".

Best of all, you'll come away with a method you can use time and time again to create your very own music, captured on professional quality lead sheets you can share with other musicians, to bring your work to life. Suitable for adults and a useful resource for teachers. Complements graded and traditional approaches to learning.`}
